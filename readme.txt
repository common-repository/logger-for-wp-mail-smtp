Provides a log of messages sent with WP SMTP Mail. Not affiliated with WP Forms, makers of the WP Mail SMTP plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin is not affiliated with WP Forms, makers of the WP Mail SMTP plugin. Please do not bother them with support requests.  It is a 3rd party solution to the lack of logging in the free version of their product. 

Please bear in mind that future updates to WP Mail SMTP may break this plugin's ability to log messages, and it may take some time for an update to be released. If they go out of their way to remove the WordPress Action Hook it depends on then an update may not be possible at all. Please use this plugin at your own risk.

This plugin has only been tested with the SMTP configuration, and not any of the other implementations provided by WP Mail SMTP. If you use it with another configuration I would be interested in hearing about you experience so that I can either confirm here that it works or make changes so that it will.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin folder named embed-custom-field in to your plugins directory, or install directly from wordpress.org

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin multisite compatible? =

Untested. Feel free to report back if you try it.

= What is the cost? =

This plugin is provided for free (that is the whole point) and as is, without warranty. If WP Forms ever sees fit to provide logging as a base feature of their own plugin then development of this alternative will cease.
